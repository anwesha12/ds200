the data for boxplot was taken from https://data.gov.in/catalog/area-and-population-haryana-statistical-abstract
the data for line and scatter plot was taken from https://data.gov.in/catalog/yearwise-expiry-mining-leases . 
From the boxplot we can see that No of leases changes from year to year but the rate of change is initially higher .
The Lease area also changes but the rate of change is very minimal .From the scatter plot we also see that the data in case of no of lease is poorly corelated where the lease area is highly corelated.
For the boxplot we can conclude that the highest population in the districts in 2011 is far more than median but this difference is less for 2001 and 1981, and for 1951 and 1901 this difference is very much less .
